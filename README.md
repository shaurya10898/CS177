# PROJECT DESCRIPTION: MagRail Launching System Simulator
This is a graphical simulator for a new magnetic rail orbital vehicle launching system for environments with varying gravitational fields. This technology uses powerful magnets to propel a launch vehicle instead of traditional rocket fuel. The project specifications require that simulation allows the user to customize the launch parameters such as gravity, heght, and angle. Then, using these parameters simulate a MagRail vehicle and provide information about its outcome. The program summarizes the results of the simulations and provides the stats for the given test parameters.
